# Zombie Cows
A mini-project that we worked on during our *Logic Programming* workshop at INSAT.
<br>
It is implemented in Prolog using __SWI Prolog__!

## Clarifications:

* In this game, Dimitri has to stay away from the zombie cows!
* __D__ stands for Dimitri.
* __Z__ stands for the zombie cows.
* __T__ stands for the trees.
* __O__ stands for the rocks.
* __S__, __B__ and __H__ stand for the living cows.
* When a zombie touches a cow, the cow turns to a zombie.
* Each round, the cows and the zombies move in a random direction, the rocks and the trees never move and you will be asked to choose the direction for Dimitri.
* nord means up, sud means down, ouest means left, est means right.

## To play:
Open SWI Prolog and consult the file.
<br>
Type *jouer*.
<br>
And then type either *nord*, *sud*, *est*, *ouest* or *reste* to move Dimitri.
